# Mini-project-Vaccine-scheduling-and-hospital-record-management-

Data Structure used: Array and linked list 

OVERVIEW :
     We have made very simple version of COWIN using C++ . We have stored data of hospitals in array of objects and each hospital holds details of vaccinated patients in a linked (better vision of this is given id 'description' file. 
     
Project is divided into two parts:

    1.Admin

    2.User


#Admin privilages:

    Admin can:
  
    1. update count of availabel vaccine in a particular hospital
  
    2. know number of patients in a hospital
    
    3. can see patient detail from every hospital and individual patient details as well
  
  
#User privilages:

    User can 

    1. register for vaccination
  
    2. View its time slot
  
    3. Cancel registration
  
  
Structure of project:

     1. Each index of array points to a list of patients stored in linked list.
     
     2. Diagram representation in description folder
   
   
Assumption : 

     1. 30 min per person for vaccination
             
     2. 5 hospitals availabel
             
     3. Considered duration of project ,1 day
             
 Further Scope: 
 
        1. The program can be further extended to include more functionality of COWIN webapp
       
        2. Instead of giving harcoded data of availabel hospital, we can attach data base
        
        3. Use UI like websit instead of console
